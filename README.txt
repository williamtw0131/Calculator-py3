This is a simple Calculator with function:
1.adding
2.sustracting
3.multiplying
4.dividing

At the begining ask user for a request,
then check for it
either +, -, *, /, quit, or a invalid request

after that in the calcaulation the checking process are all same

which are asking for first number,
checking it for not being a string.
if it pass, then ask for a second one,
then check it again.

only in dividing, we have to check for dividing by zero
still we can use try-except-else here
but i figure it's easier just use if-else

that's all.
